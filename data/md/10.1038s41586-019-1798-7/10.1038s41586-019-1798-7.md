| Received: 24 August 2018 Accepted: 18 September 2019 Published online: 11 December 2019 | Limiting the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is one of the largest challenges of our  generation1 . Because carbon capture and storage is one of the few viable technologies  that can mitigate current CO2 emissions2 , much efort is focused on developing solid  adsorbents that can efciently capture CO2 from fue gases emitted from  anthropogenic sources3 . One class of materials that has attracted considerable  interest in this context is metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), in which the careful  combination of organic ligands with metal-ion nodes can, in principle, give rise to  innumerable structurally and chemically distinct nanoporous MOFs. However, many  MOFs that are optimized for the separation of CO2 from nitrogen4–7  do not perform  well when using realistic fue gas that contains water, because water competes with  CO2 for the same adsorption sites and thereby causes the materials to lose their  selectivity. Although fue gases can be dried, this renders the capture process  prohibitively expensive8,9 . Here we show that data mining of a computational  screening library of over 300,000 MOFs can identify diferent classes of strong CO2- binding sites—which we term 'adsorbaphores'—that endow MOFs with CO2/N2 selectivity that persists in wet fue gases. We subsequently synthesized two waterstable MOFs containing the most hydrophobic adsorbaphore, and found that their  carbon-capture performance is not afected by water and outperforms that of some  commercial materials. Testing the performance of these MOFs in an industrial setting  and consideration of the full capture process—including the targeted CO2 sink, such as  geological storage or serving as a carbon source for the chemical industry—will be  necessary to identify the optimal separation material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Different strategies have been developed to mitigate the negative effects of water on the CO2/N2 separation selectivity in MOF materials. 

For example, some MOFs have open metal sites at which amines can be attached, taking advantage of the specific amine chemistry that is also used in conventional amine scrubbing10–13. A previous screening study14 investigated whether MOFs could adsorb CO2 in the presence of water, and the results suggested that such MOFs could be de novo designed. In this work, we develop a systematic strategy for the design and preparation of custom-made MOFs that can capture carbon from wet flue gases. Our design methodology is inspired by the rational design of drug molecules, in which organic molecules that fit well into the binding pocket of a protein are mined from databases of known chemicals15,16. The difference in our case is that the 'drug molecule' is known (that is, CO2), but the substrate that binds it optimally (the MOF) 
is not. We therefore generated a library of 325,000 hypothetical MOFs, and screened each material for its CO2/N2 selectivity and its CO2 working capacity. The chemical building blocks used in the generation of these materials are shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2. Figure 1a shows that 8,325 hypothetical materials possess a working capacity for CO2 greater than 2 mmol g−1 and a CO2/N2 selectivity greater than 50—performance that surpasses that of zeolite 13X under dry conditions17.

A key part of drug design is to analyse the optimally binding molecules for a common feature or spatial arrangement of atoms at the binding site, which is known as the pharmacophore15. In analogy with this, we coin the term 'adsorbaphore' to describe the common pore shape and chemistry of a binding site in a MOF that provides optimal interactions to preferentially bind to a particular guest molecule, in this case CO2. From our top-ranked 8,325 materials, we identified 1 Laboratory of Molecular Simulation (LSMO), Institut des Sciences et Ingénierie Chimiques, Valais (ISIC), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Sion, Switzerland. 2Research Centre for Carbon Solutions (RCCS), School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK. 3Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. 4Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. 5Institut des Sciences et Ingénierie Chimiques (ISIC), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland. 6Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain. 7Materials Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. 8Present address: Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 9Present address: Department of Chemistry, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US. 10These authors contributed equally: Peter G.

106,680 such CO2-binding sites (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for examples). 

A similarity analysis of these binding sites revealed three main classes of adsorbaphore: A1, two parallel aromatic rings with interatomic spacings of approximately 7 Å (31% of all binding sites); A2, metal–oxygen–
metal bridges (32%); and A3, open metal sites (21%) (see Supplementary Information for details). Subsequently, we screened the materials that possessed these adsorbaphores for their affinity for water. Figure 1b

shows the Henry coefficient for water in these high-performing materials. Analysis of the data shows that the materials with the parallel aromatic rings (A1) have a low Henry coefficient for H2O, whereas those with metal–oxygen bridges (A2) and open metal sites (A3) tend to have higher Henry coefficients (Fig. 1b). A graphical representation of the different adsorbaphores is presented in Extended Data Fig. 4. Comparison of the binding energies—computed using density functional theory—for the adsorbaphore shown in Fig. 1c indicates a preference for CO2 (−10.2 kcal mol−1) over N2 and H2O by 2.7 and 1.5 kcal mol−1, respectively (see Extended Data Table 1). The parallel aromatic rings provide a nearoptimum interaction with all three atoms of CO2, whereas for H2O the lack of hydrogen-bonding sites limits its binding energy.

The next step was to identify a subclass of MOFs in our library that contains the preferred adsorbaphore. From an experimental point of view, MOFs with the frz topology—characterized by tetra-carboxylated organic ligands coordinated to one-dimensional metal–oxygen rodsare an attractive starting point. One such example has been synthesized with indium as a metal node, resulting in a structurally stable, non-breathing MOF18. In this topology, the metal rods provide an ideal scaffolding to which we can attach our adsorbaphore. By varying the metal ion we have some flexibility to tune the distance between the aromatic rings. Our calculations predict that the ideal adsorbaphore distance of 6.5–7.0 Å—which was determined by adjusting the spacing of the aromatic rings incrementally (Extended Data Fig. 5)—can be approached if In(iii) is replaced by Al(iii) (Extended Data Table 2). In addition, aluminium is an attractive choice because it is an abundant metal and it ensures a strong bond with the carboxylate O-atoms of the ligands19; this considerably improves the thermal and hydrolytic stability of a MOF20,21.

We generated a library of 35 isoreticular materials using our MOF-generation algorithm22, and from the mixture isotherms we computed the

and **[Al-PyrMOF]** (b).

CO2/N2 selectivity of the materials in dry and wet flue gases (Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7). Our calculations show that all of our predicted materials maintain an excellent selectivity at low pressures, and in about 75% 
of these materials the selectivity was not influenced by the presence of water under flue-gas conditions. The concept of an adsorbaphore focuses on the design of an adsorption site that optimizes selectivities at low pressure. At higher partial pressures of water, its adsorption is dominated by the energetics of hydrogen-bond formation. Further analyses showed that, for the materials that maintain a high CO2 uptake at high humidity, it is the pore shape that frustrates the formation of these hydrogen bonds. This is illustrated in Fig. 2a, b, which compares the effect of water on the CO2 uptake of two materials that have the same adsorbaphore but different pore structures (hypothetical MOFs m8o67 and **m8o71**). Figure 2a shows that **m8o67** is resistant to H2O 
flooding: even at a relative humidity of approximately 85%, we find that H2O has only a small effect on CO2 capacity. Conversely, **m8o71**
completely loses its CO2 capacity at 60% relative humidity (Fig. 2b). 

In Fig. 2c, d we visualize the hydrogen-bond network that is formed at 100% relative humidity in both materials. For **m8o71** we see a complete hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 2d), whereas for **m8o67** (Fig. 2c) we observe a less extensive network; the benzoate groups that separate the adsorbaphores frustrate the formation of a complete hydrogenbonding network.

On the basis of these predictions, we synthesized two frz-based MOFs using organic ligands that possess the water-frustrating properties reported above: **Al-PMOF**19 (**m8o66**) and Al-PyrMOF (**m8o67**). 

These MOFs are based on one-dimensional rods of Al(iii) linked by TCPP (tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and TBAPy (1,3,6,8-tetrakis
(p-benzoic acid)pyrene) ligands, respectively (Fig. 3a, b). Figure 3c, d shows no loss of crystallinity upon activation as well as upon exposure to different harsh conditions, including immersion in water for 7 days. 

By identifying adsorbaphores in these hypothetical materials, we assume that our in silico screening method can correctly predict the structure of a MOF, its adsorption properties, and the nature of the binding sites of CO2 and H2O. We are able to test these assumptions for **Al-PMOF** and **Al-PyrMOF**. In Fig. 4a we show that the experimental and predicted CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms are in good agreement. 

The CO2 binding positions in the adsorbaphore and the effect of H2O 
are more challenging to observe experimentally. The siting of CO2 was studied using in situ CO2-loading powder X-ray diffraction. Upon loading, we observed a considerable change in the intensity and peak position of the Bragg reflections (see Supplementary Fig. 2.1). Subsequent Rietveld refinement and Fourier analysis23 revealed the preferred locations of CO2 in the pores of **Al-PMOF**, as shown in Fig. 4b. These results confirm that CO2 preferentially adsorbs in the adsorbaphore.

The effect of water on the siting of CO2 has been further addressed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Under magicangle spinning (MAS), high-resolution 13C NMR chemical shifts are very sensitive to changes in the chemical environment. The 13C NMR spectra of **Al-PyrMOF** and **Al-PMOF** are provided in Extended Data Fig. 8, which also shows the assignment of the peaks to specific atoms on the MOF. 

The chemical shifts associated with the atoms of the adsorbophore 
(inset) are shown in Fig. 4c as a function of the water concentration. At low levels the adsorbophore atoms experience no change in chemical environment with water loading, whereas at the highest water loadings there are modest changes in the carbon-13 chemical shifts of only those atoms that are close to the aluminium-coordinated carboxylate groups next to the adsorbaphore (carbons B and F in Fig. 4c). This broadening is consistent with dipolar broadening from proximate water molecules, thus confirming that the adsorbaphore itself is not a preferential adsorption site for H2O.

Our simulations predict that CO2 adsorbed in the adsorbaphore is insulated from the adsorption of water. Because the 13C NMR spectrum of adsorbed 13CO2 is extremely sensitive to the proximity of water molecules in terms of chemical shift and line broadening, any disruption of the chemical environment of adsorbed CO2 by water should be immediately apparent. Figure 4d shows that the chemical shift of the adsorbed 13CO2 is independent of water content, although a broadening of the 13C NMR peak is observed with increasing humidity. 

If this broadening is due to the proximity of the protons in water, it should disappear if the experiments are repeated using D2O; however, it does not (Fig. 4d). This observation corroborates our simulation results (Fig. 2c), confirming that water has only a limited effect on CO2 adsorption in **Al-PyrMOF**.

The ability of these materials to capture CO2 from wet flue gases is of important practical concern. We therefore used a breakthrough experiment to determine the capture capacity of both **Al-PMOF** and Al-PyrMOF for a mixture of CO2/N2 under dry- and humid-conditions24
(Fig. 4e). These results confirm the predictions of the simulations 
(Extended Data Fig. 7): humidity in the flue gases has only a minimal influence on the capture capacity of **Al-PMOF**, whereas for **Al-PyrMOF** the capture capacity is in fact enhanced. Furthermore, repeated cycling25 (Fig. 4f) does not result in degradation of the material or a change in separation performance. It is instructive to compare the performance of our materials with that of a set of reference materials, including those that are commercially available—such as zeolite 13X 
and activated carbon—and a water stable, amino-functionalized MOF, 
UiO-66-NH2. The capture capacity of these reference materials lies between that of **Al-PyrMOF** and **Al-PMOF** in dry flue gases; however, unlike our MOFs, their performance reduces considerably in humid flue gases. Although our materials do not have the highest reported

against UiO-66-NH2, activated carbon and zeolite 13X under dry and humid (85% relative humidity) conditions, with 85/15 v/v of N2/CO2 (313 K and 1 bar). 

For wet flue gases, we studied the performance stability after 3 cycles for reference materials, and after 10 cycles for **[Al-PyrMOF]** and **[Al-PMOF]**.

working capacities14, it is encouraging to see that, in wet flue gases, Al-PMOF outperforms commercial materials such as zeolite 13X and activated carbon.

Large-scale screening of databases of hypothetical MOFs for various gas separation and storage applications has been reported previously26–29; however, here we have focused on identifying binding pockets—or structural motifs termed adsorbaphores—as synthetic targets, rather than whole materials. This enhances the synthetic viability of the approach, as demonstrated by the identification of one new material with the targeted adsorbaphore that was synthesized and shown to adsorb CO2 as predicted. The concept of linking computational screening with the synthesis of the corresponding materials through such adsorbaphores should be applicable to other gas separations of increasing complexity.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Hypothetical material generation (2). a , Metal SBUs used in the generation of the hypothetical MOF database. b, Functional groups used to decorate the unfunctionalized hypothetical MOFs in the database. We denote a hypothetical material as mXoYY, where X refers to the metal SBU
shown in a and YY refers to the organic SBU shown in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Functional groups were decorated onto the base hypothetical materials using an internal numbering system.

representative adsorbaphores obtained from visual inspection of the top 50 most frequent adsorbaphores found from the random pairing method described in the Supplementary Information. There are three major trends in the molecular fragments-labelled A1, A2 and A3-which can be observed upon descending each column. The number of chemical features of the fragments increases from left to right across each row. This is accomplished by increasing search, called the minimum clique threshold (MCT). Pictured in each adsorbaphore is a representative contour map of the energy produced from CO, binding with the adsorbaphore atoms from each original CO, binding site.

a-c, Al, planar aromatic systems, in which CO2 binds in between the stacked rings; d-f, A2, CO, binds near the bridging oxygen of a pillared vanadium SBU;
g-i, A3, CO, binds between open-metal Cr SBUs.

decorate these materials. We refer to the synthesized versions of m8066 and m8067 as Al-PMOF (Al 2 (OH) 2 (H 2 TCPP)) and Al-PyrMOF (Al 2 (OH) 2 (TBAPy)),
respectively.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | CO, adsorption capacity of a class of frz-based hypothetical MOFs at 0.15 bar and 313K under 'wet' (85% relative humidity)
and 'dry' flue gas conditions. Top, middle, hypothetical MOFs in which the organic ligand is connected to the Al ion via 4 benzoate moieties; bottom, hypothetical MOFs in which the organic ligand is connected to the Al metal ion via 4 acetylenic carboxylate moieties. The materials are ranked from lowest adsorbaphore density to highest, and the number on the xaxis corresponds to the organic linker number (YY) in m80YY (see Extended Data Fig. 6).
