Porous coordination polymer 2,6-Dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid 4,4′-Bipyridine Mixed ligands Luminescence properties A new porous coordination polymer, namely [Zn2(MPDC)2(4,4′-Bpy)(DMF)]·(DMF) 1 (H2MPDC = 2,6dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid, 4,4′-Bpy = 4,4′-bipyridine, DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide), has been successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions. The result of crystal structural analysis indicates that compound 1 shows a three-dimensional (3D) network framework with 1-D channels along the a-axis. From the view of topology, the framework of 1 can be represented as a 2, 3, 4-connected net. Further characterization of compound 1 was performed by X-ray powder diffraction, thermal gravimetric analyses, and infrared spectra. In addition, compound 1 exhibits strong photoluminescent emissions in the solid state at room temperature.

In the past two decades, porous coordination polymers (PCPs), as a new class of well-ordered crystalline materials, have attracted researchers' intensively interests not only for their intriguing structural topologies but also for their potential applications as functional materials in gas storage and separation, catalysis, nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, sensors, magnetism, luminosity, porous materials, and so on
[1–3]. Thus, much effort has been devoted to the design and controlled synthesis of porous coordination polymers with unique structures and properties each year [4]. However, to be able to rationally design and construct PCPs with predicted geometries is still a great challenge, as many factors can affect the overall structural formation [5,6].

Among these factors, the structures of the organic ligands play an important role in directing the construction of PCPs with anticipative architectures and functionalities [7]. Recently, 2,3-/2,4-/2,5-/2,6-/3,4-/
3,5-pyridinedicarboxylates (PDCs) have been extensively studied and these ligands containing multi-oxygen and nitrogen atoms and can coordinate with metal ions in different ways, resulting in the formations of various PCPs with specific topologies and interesting properties [8–10]. Compared with these common pyridine dicarboxylic acids (PDCs) effectively utilized in the construction of PCPs, the highlysubstituted PDCs have not been well noticed in the construction of PCPs, for example, only a few 2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid
(H2MPDC)-based compounds were reported [8,11–15]. Similar to the 3,5-PDC ligand, H2MPDC is also a rigid V-shaped tri-connected ligand,

especially, two non-coordinated –CH3 groups induce a spatial effect on the coordinated nitrogen atom, greatly influencing the structure of the resulting complexes.

As is known, one of the most effective strategies to assemble PCPs is to apply mixed multifunctional organic ligands to connect metal ions. The mixed organic ligands may play different roles in the formation of the final structure of the product [16,17]. As an extension of our research, we choose 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-Bpy) as auxiliary ligand on the basis that it was experimentally proven to be a very useful N-containing auxiliary ligand with extensive coordination polymer chemistry [18,19]. Besides, d10 metal ions present variable coordination numbers and geometries, and their complexes generally exhibit luminescent properties [20].

Taking these into consideration, we introduced 4,4′-bipyridine into the system of the H2MPDC ligands with d10 metal ions (Zn II), an interesting three-dimensional porous coordination polymers, [Zn2(MPDC)
2(4,4′-Bpy)(DMF)]·(DMF) 1, was obtained under solvothermal conditions. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic P-1 space group. The detailed crystallographic data and selected bond lengths and angles for compound 1 are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively [21].

Pale yellow rod-like crystals of the metal organic framework were synthesized solvothermally by reacting Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, H2MPDC and 4,4′-bipyridine in molar ratio of 2:3:25 in DMF/CH3CN at 85 °C for 10 h and at 105 °C for 48 h [22]. As shown in Fig. S1, there are two Zn2+ ions, one μ2-MPDC2− anion, one μ3-MPDC2− anion, one 4,4′-Bpy molecule, one coordinated DMF molecule and one uncoordinated DMF
molecule (Fig. 1). The Zn(1)2+ ion adopts an ideal tetrahedral

anion, one oxygen atom (O(4)) from a μ2-MPDC2− anion, and one nitrogen atom (N(1)) from a bridging 4,4′-Bpy molecule to form a [Zn(1)
NO3] unit (Fig. 2a). The Zn(1)–L (L = O, N) distances are in the range of 1.992(2)–2.060(2), and the trans L–Zn(1)–L bond angles are in the range of 94.85(9)–140.07(10)°. Then the Zn(2)2+ ion is fourcoordinated with two oxygen atoms (O(6), O(8A)) from a μ3-MPDC2−
anion and a μ2-MPDC2− anion, one oxygen atom (O(9)) from a DMF molecule, one nitrogen atom (N(2)) from a bridging 4,4′-Bpy molecule to form a distorted tetrahedron [Zn(2)NO3] (Fig. 2b). The Zn(2)–L
(L= O, N) distances are in the range of 1.992(2)–2.064(3), and the trans L–Zn(2)–L bond angles are in the range of 89.22(11)–139.97(14)°. Four
[ZnNO3] units are surrounded by two μ2-MPDC2− ligands and two μ3-
MPDC2− ligands to form an 8-ring unit. The adjacent 8-rings are further linked together through the μ3-MPDC2− ligands to construct a 1-D
channel along the a-axis direction, and such 1-D channels are further connected by the 4,4′-Bpy bridges to form a 3-D framework (Fig. 2c and d). The porous sizes are approximately 9.820 × 9.312 Å (measured by the Zn…Zn distances), in which the pores are occupied by coordinated DMF molecules. To better understand the framework topology, compound 1 can be simplified as a combination of 2-connected nodes (4,4′-Bpy molecules and μ2-MPDC2− anions), 3-connected nodes (μ3-MPDC2− anions) and 4-connected nodes (Zn(1)2+ and Zn(2)2+ ions); the assembly of these three types of nodes results in the generation of a 3D network (Fig. 2e and f).

The simulated and experimental XRD patterns of 1 have been shown in Fig. S2. Their peak positions correspond well with the results simulated from the single crystal data, indicating the phase purity of the synthesized samples.

IR data (KBr pellet υ/cm−1): 2927 (w), 2848 (w), 1657 (s), 1604
(vs), 1430 (m), 1422 (m), 1370 (vs), 1222(w), 1144(w), 1074(w),
840(m), 795(m), 700(s) and 640(m) (Fig. S3). It exhibits weak absorption peaks in the range of 3000–2800 cm−1 due to the stretching vibrations of C–H groups. There are no absorption peaks around 1700 cm−1
(–COOH) indicating completely deprotonation of carboxyl groups in the compound [23]. The strong peaks at 1657–1604 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of C_N and C_C. And the peaks centered at 1430 cm−1 and 1370 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of C–O and C–N groups, respectively. The δO–C–O vibration in plane occurs in middle intensity peaks in the range of 857–700 cm−1.

Color code: carbon: gray; nitrogen: blue; oxygen: red; zinc: green.
The thermal stability of compound was examined by the TG analysis at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 35 to 800 °C. The TG curve of 1 shows a major weight loss of 80.13% in the temperature range of 100 to 490 °C, corresponding to the loss of two DMF molecules, one 4,4′-
Bpy molecule and two H2MPDC molecules in the framework (calc.

79.33%). The residual weight of 19.87% corresponds to ZnO (calc. 20.67%) (see ESI Fig. S4).

The luminescent properties of H2MPDC and compound 1 were investigated in solid state at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 3, compound 1 exhibits strong photoluminescence with emission maximum at 545 nm upon excitation at 466 nm. For excitation wavelength at 467 nm, a rather weak photoluminescence emission is observed for H2MPDC ligands (λem = 531 nm). Compared with the free H2MPDC
ligand, red shift of 14 nm in compound 1 has been observed. Furthermore, luminescent property of the compound 1 is much better than that of free H2MPDC ligand, which might be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The observation indicates that compound 1 may be an excellent candidate for potential photoactive materials.

In summary, we have synthesized a new porous coordination polymer based on H2MPDC, 4,4′-Bpy mixed ligands and d10 metal ions
(Zn II) under solvothermal conditions. Compound 1 is a 3-D framework constructed from 1-D channels. From the view of topology, the framework of 1 can be represented as a 2, 3, 4-connected net. The fluorescent emission shows that compound 1 may be a good candidate for photoactive materials. It is believed that more porous coordination polymers with interesting structures as well as physical properties will be synthesized by using H2MPDC and 4,4′-Bpy as mixed ligands, and this work is underway in our laboratory now.

[21] Structure crystal structure analysis: suitable single crystal of 1 (0.26 × 0.17 × 0.11 mm)
was selected for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The intensity data were collected on a Bruker SMART-APEX CCD diffractometer for 1 (λ(Mo-K
α) = 0. 71073 Å). The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXTL Version 5.1. All the metal atoms were located firstly, then the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms of 1 were subsequently found in difference Fourier maps. The hydrogen atoms of the ligands were placed geometrically. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
